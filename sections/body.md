## Mission  
Contracts are important. They enable people and businesses to work together, while clearly understanding each others’ obligations \- at least, in theory. In practice, everyone hates contracts \- how many times have you clicked “I accept the terms and conditions” without reading them?

Businesses don’t have the luxury of blindly accepting terms and conditions \- that’s a great way to get sued. Businesses need to actually review, understand, and negotiate contracts. That makes them hate contracts even more than you do \- and yet, they’re utterly reliant on them. Without contracts, they’d have no way to trust other businesses. Global commerce would fall apart, warlords would take over, and there would be cannibalism in the streets.

And even the warlords would need contracts.

Dealing with contracts is expensive, time consuming, and blocks actual deals \- every day, every business in the world is waiting for their lawyers to review their contracts. Despite all of this, contracts are critically important. Our mission is to make dealing with contracts so fast and easy that the businesses basically forget they’re there. We’re doing this with AI.

## Why now?  
The earliest contracts were carved into clay tablets in ancient Mesopotamia. They haven’t changed much since then. Today, contracts still use the word “witnesseth\!”

The reason contracts move so slowly is because lawyers are fundamentally opposed to risk. The entire point of contracts is to reduce risk \- which means that the people who deal with them naturally don’t like change.

But the world is changing beneath them. For the first time in history, we have a tool that can understand and manipulate contracts for us \- Large Language Models. Companies that use LLMs have a distinct advantage over companies that don’t \- they can move faster, close deals faster, and out-compete their peers. There is incredible market pressure on businesses to adapt, which translates into pressure on their legal teams.

Risk-adverse or not, they need LLMs today. ChatGPT isn’t up to the task and the lawyers can’t build the tech themselves. As such, they’re practically begging for a product like ours.

## What are the challenges?  
The main challenges are technical. For a business, a single deal accelerated by Ivo can justify our entire annual license fee. There is so much demand for our product that \- if we nail the technical problems \- the product practically sells itself.

For our product to succeed, it must be:

* Accurate  
* Fast  
* Easy to use

**Accurate**: LLMs have problems. They can hallucinate. They’re nondeterministic. They act like bored teenagers sometimes and don’t pay attention, and don’t do as they’re told. Building an accurate contract review tool on top of this foundation is like building a railroad over a bog.

[But, great engineers can build railroads over bogs.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_and_Manchester_Railway#Construction)

**Fast**: LLMs are slow. To increase accuracy, we need to use bigger models and longer pipelines, which makes them even slower. In the long run, they’ll speed up because NVIDIA keeps making faster GPUs, but we can’t wait that long. We need to go faster today. Making an LLM-based product fast today is like making a motorcycle from 1920 hit 188mph.

[But, great engineers can make motorcycles from 1920 hit 188mph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burt_Munro#Records/runs) \- even if they were originally designed to only hit 55\.

**Easy to use**: Don’t worry, we have a designer for this.

## What are we building?

We’re building a platform that makes dealing with contracts a breeze. This includes every interaction with contracts \- from the initial drafting, through review, negotiation, approval and signing, and finally search \- so businesses can understand the contracts they’ve signed.

Think back to all the terms and conditions you’ve accepted. How many of them are you violating right now? You’re lucky no one cares enough to sue you. Again, businesses don’t have that luxury. They need to abide by the millions of restrictions in the thousands of contracts they’ve signed. 

Our solution is a platform that understands contracts from the beginning to the end, better than any legal team on the planet.

(Don’t worry. This is an accessibly low bar.)

We’re going piece by piece, in order of how much pain they cause businesses. Contract review and negotiation are the most painful, so we tackled them first. Our contract review/negotiation tool is so much better than any alternative, it sells itself. Don’t believe us? Ask our sales team.

*“Thank you, engineering team, for making my job so easy. It’s literally the easiest job I’ve ever had. This product is so much better than any alternative, it sells itself. I just put it in front of prospects and they buy it.”* \- Sales Guy Adam (paraphrased).

The next big problem is search. Contracts are written in legalese, which is notoriously difficult to understand. Traditional search engines crumble in the face of nested clauses full of exclusions and cutouts. Even basic questions like “which of our vendor agreements are auto-renewing next month?” are too hard to answer with pre-LLM technology \- not without a whole lot of manual labor, and ain’t nobody got time for that. Businesses are stuck auto-renewing subscriptions for software they haven’t used in 10 years because they can’t find the contracts they need to cancel.

Don’t worry, businesses. We got you.

Once we solve that problem, we’ll move on to the next one, then the next one. We won’t stop until every contract spends every stage of its life in Ivo, every major business is a customer, and every in-house lawyer occasionally wakes up in cold sweats, screaming from their nightmare of having to go back to the way things used to be. Before Ivo. The dark times.

## Where are we today

We’re at \~$2M in ARR, which we expect to quadruple in the next 12 months. Our Contract Review tool is best-in-market, consistently winning trials against our competitors. If a trial is competitive, it actually increases the odds of us closing the deal \- let’s check in with Adam again.

*“Man, I love competitive deals. Our product blows our competitors out of the water. Whenever a prospect compares us against a competitor, I know I’m going to be making that deal. It forces them to compare us against reality instead of their imagination, you know?”* \- Sales Guy Adam (paraphrased)

Ivo™. Better than realistic alternatives since 2023\.

We’re building our second tool, the Search Agent. This lets businesses ask questions across all of their contracts \- questions that legal teams currently have to answer manually, which can take days. We will be releasing this in a matter of weeks. All gas no brakes\!.

We raised a $16M series A at the end of 2024\. Our team is now 25 people in San Francisco. We have 7 engineers, and will scale up to \~12. 

## Our long term vision

The legal tech market has yet to see a generational company that solves the problems of contracts once and for all. Contract Lifecycle Management systems (CLMs) promised a solution decades ago, and have yet to deliver. Their products have extremely long implementation times, cost an arm and a leg, require tons of manual labor, and have very low customer satisfaction. 

Recent AI progress means that many of the paradigms in CLMs no longer make sense. For many businesses, they never did. By building AI into the core of our products, we will finally free businesses from the headaches of dealing with contracts, and allow them to do what they do best: Get down to business.

## Engineering at Ivo  
We’re not the only company who’s figured out that LLMs can handle contracts. We have competitors. We’re in a startup knife fight. But, as you’ve heard from Adam, we blow them out of the water. Why?

Simple: We have better engineers.

It’s almost impossible to get hired as an engineer at Ivo (if you’re incompetent, that is). We have such a high bar that even our junior engineers are geniuses. Better engineers produce better code, which means better products, faster. If you get hired at Ivo, you can confidently know that you’re in a small, elite team of highly competent people who are in it to win it.

The basic capabilities of LLMs are just as available to our competitors as they are to us. To produce a better product, we must extend beyond the basics by using traditional programming techniques. God only knows how many algorithms we’ve invented and thrown away to push our accuracy a couple percent higher, but that’s okay \- algorithms, data structures, and pragmatic engineering are how we win.

As such, we don’t hire for tech stack knowledge. We don’t care if you have *x* years of experience in React, or *y* years in C++. We hire for intelligence, fundamental computer science aptitude, and the ability to get things done. Anyone who has those can pick up our stack, no problem.

## The Daily Grind  
Here are some example problems we’ve solved in the past month alone:

* Representing contracts as [merkle trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) to avoid redundantly querying LLMs about clauses which have been copied between contracts (many such cases)  
* Building a [communicating sequential processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes) library in JavaScript so we can share code and data between our frontend and backend, while pretending we’re writing in go.  
* Writing an AI agent that generates [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) on the fly, to speed up automatic metadata extraction.

It goes on. Every day, customers raise the bar on us by asking for new features, or to handle harder edge cases. Engineering at Ivo requires a combination of creative thinking and diligent experimentation \- no one has ever solved the problems we’re solving before, so we’re forced to invent the solutions ourselves.
