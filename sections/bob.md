## The Tale of Careful Bob

Bob is a lawyer. He works at Jim's Widgets Inc, and he hates his life.

The sales team is constantly nagging Bob to review contracts faster. They make fun of him, and call him "Slow Bob."

But Bob isn't slow for no reason\! Bob is slow because he doesn't want Jim's Widgets to get sued into oblivion. If they do, the sales team and everyone else will be fired. "Slow Bob" is unfair. They should call him "Careful Bob".

Careful Bob is a hero\!

Nevertheless, the CEO is breathing down Careful Bob's neck.

"Bob, we need to hit our quarterly sales targets\! If you don't turn these contracts around faster, we'll fail to raise our next round and everyone will be fired\!"

Oh no. Rock and a hard place.

Bob is desperate. He needs to review these contracts faster, but without sacrificing quality. He can't lose another job. Last time, his wife almost divorced him.

He starts drinking at work. His intern, Jake, senses his stress.

"You okay, Bob?" Jake asks.

"Too many contracts," Bob sobs.

"Have you thought of using AI? My friend told me about this sick tool."

The last time Bob thought about AI, it was when Terminator was released and Arnold Schwarzenegger was still cool.

"Won't that mess everything up?" Bob asks.

"Nah b, I heard it's really good."

Bob is curious. He heads over to Ivo AI and schedules a demo.

Now, it needs to actually work. Save Careful Bob's marriage. Save Jimâ€™s Widgets. Come build Ivo.
